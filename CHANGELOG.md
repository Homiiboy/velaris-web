## V0.0.2 — 2026-09-07 — Visual Foundation

### Added

- native `velaris` theme as the default Velaris Web appearance
- centralized Velaris design tokens derived from the logo palette
- modular styling foundation for surfaces, buttons, forms, navigation, dialogs and accessibility
- cyan → blue → violet → magenta → pink accent gradient system
- dedicated MUI color scheme matching the legacy Jellyfin component palette
- reduced-motion support and consistent keyboard focus treatment
- final visual polish layer for card overlays, media badges, progress bars and surface depth
- subtle microinteractions for cards, lists and controls

### Changed

- Velaris now defaults to its own theme while keeping upstream themes selectable
- dark surfaces use a near-black cinematic palette with subtle cyan and violet ambient lighting
- cards, lists, dialogs and drawers use a consistent radius, border, shadow and glass treatment
- form controls, interactive states and progress indicators now share the Velaris accent language
- buttons now use more restrained glow, depth and active-state feedback
- inputs now have refined hover, focus and placeholder states
- cards now use subtler lift, image-edge highlights and focus rings

### Validation

- V0.0.2 is validated by Velaris CI with TypeScript, ESLint, Stylelint, unit tests and a production build

### Compatibility
